    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world. Took the midnight train
      going anywhere. Met a small town boy, born and raised in South Detroit,
      he took the midnight train going anywhere. Strangers, waiting, up and down the
      boulevard and shadows, searching in the night. Streetlights, people, living just
      to find emotion, hiding somewhere in the night.</p>
      <p>I wear short skirts, I wear t-shirts. I'm cheer captain, AND I'm on the bleachers.
        I'm dreaming about the day when you wake up and find that what you're looking for
        (in a photographer) has been here the whole time.</p>
      <p>I'm good at wasting time, I think lyrics need to rhyme. And you're not asking,
        but I'm trying to (get my boyfriend) to grow a mustache. I eat cheese, but only on
        pizza, please, and sometimes on a homemade quesadilla, otherwise it smells
        like feet to me.</p>
